A daemon integrating the custom HofBox LoRaWAN protocol into ChirpStack applications via the ChirpStack gateway bridge.

## Config

```toml
# Connection information for the ChirpStack API
[chirpstack_api]
# ChirpStack API token (generated in the web interface)
api_token="abcd"
# Tenenat ID if available, leave empty ("") for admin usage
tenant_id="abcd"
# ChirpStack URL and port
url="http://127.0.0.1"
port=8080

# MQTT configuration
[mqtt]
# MQTT broker URL and port
url="127.0.0.1"
port=1883
# Client ID identifies the Spatz daemon to the MQTT broker
client_id="spatz-daemon"

[daemon]
# The address and port the Spatz daemon shoul bind to
bind_addr="127.0.0.1"
bind_port=3000
# List of default end device IDs
end_device_ids=["1234567890", "0987654321"]

# Message cache config, the message cache keeps track of what messages have already been sent/seen
[daemon.message_cache]
# Timeout after which the message is considered new again
timeout_minutes=30
# Iterval at which the cache entries are checked for expiry
cleanup_interval_seconds=30
# Whether to reset the timeout back to the initial amount if the message is seen again
reset_timeout=false

# Configuration for the send manager
[daemon.send_config]
# At what interval should messages be sent (seconds)
periodic_send_delay=5
# Size of the relay queue, hold single messages received via LoRaWAN uplink
relay_queue_size=10
# Bundle send buffer queue, hold whole bundles
bundle_queue_size=10
# Announcement send buffer queue, holds whole announcements
announcement_queue_size=10
```

## Usage
The daemon expects a file path to a config file as described above.
```
./spatz --config-file-path path/to/file
```

## API
The OpenAPI spec for Spatz is hosted at `/api.json`.

## Debugging
### API
List end device IDs
```shell
curl 127.0.0.1:3000/api/end_devices
```
Add end device IDs
```shell
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"end_devices": ["1","2","3","4"]}' 127.0.0.1:3000/api/end_devices
```
Remove end device IDs
```shell
curl -X DELETE -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"end_devices": ["1","2","3","4"]}' 127.0.0.1:3000/api/end_devices
```
