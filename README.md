# LoRaWAN DTN

This project aims to provide an interface for DTN based multi-hop communication to other applications. It exploits an existing Chirpstack setup and integrates into the internal MQTT broker for transceiving messages via LoRaWAN gateways.

This setup requires at least two Gateway setups (in LoRaWAN range) to be functional, as it is intended to exchange data between such setups in times of network outages.
