# ChirpStack GatewayBridge Integration Client

A small cli tool for sending/receiving data through a ChirpStack-enabled LoRaWAN-Gateway.

## Usage
The daemon expects a file path to a config file (same config file format as used by [Spatz](../spatz)).

Alternatively you can also specify the following options directly via the CLI:
* `--api-token "API_TOKEN"` (set ChirpStack API Token)
* `--tenant-id "TENANT_ID"` (set ChirpStack Tenant ID)
* `--chirpstack_url "URL"`  (set URL of ChirpStack, e.g. `127.0.0.1`)
* `--chirpstack_port "PORT"` (set HTTP-Port of ChirpStack, e.g. `8080`)
* `--mqtt_url "URL"` (set URL of MQTT, e.g. `127.0.0.1`)
* `--mqtt_port "PORT"` (set port of MQTT, e.g. `1883`)


Example commands for both modes, listening (receiving) and downlink (sending) are as follows:

### Listening

```
cargo run -- --config-file config/config_file.toml listening 
```
The `listening` subcommand allows following options:

* `--prefix NUMBER` (allow to filter incoming messages, based on first payload byte, NUMBER must be between 0 and 255)
* `--verbose` (enable verbose mode)


### Downlink

```
cargo run -- --config-file config/config_file.toml downlink --payload "Test" --spreading-factor=7 --prefix 224
```

The `downlink` subcommand allows following options:


* `--frequency NUMBER` (set frequency, NUMBER must be 868100000, 868300000, or 868500000)
* `--bandwidth NUMBER` (set bandwidth, NUMBER must be 125000 or 250000)
* `--spreading_factor NUMBER` (set spreading factor, must be between 7 and 12)
* `--data_rate NUMBER` (set data rate and overwrites frequency and spreading factor settings, NUMBER must be between 0 and 6)
* `--payload "STRING"` (set payload)
* `--network_id` (set network ID)
* `--prefix NUMBER` (allow to set a prefix byte, NUMBER must be between 0 and 255)
* `--verbose` (enable verbose mode)
